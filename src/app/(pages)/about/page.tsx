        Our software company was born in 2009. Back then, cell phones were used to make calls and send SMS messages (believe it or not!) and Orkut was in its inevitable decline. Today, everything has changed, and so have we. We matured, got even better at what we were already good at, and learned a lot about what we didn't know. Now we are social, technological, and digital experts. We are the improved version of ourselves.

        But some things havenâ€™t changed. We still believe that excellence is the only way to achieve our goals. We still think that communication is made by people and for people. We also understand that strategy, creativity, and performance only work with a strong willingness to experiment, dedication, and, when necessary, a touch of boldness to move forward.
